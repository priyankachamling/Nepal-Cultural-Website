  <h2> Dhaka Products </h2>   
   <p>One of the main appearances of Nepalese men that come to our mind is an ever-smiling face with a cute little ‘topi’(cap) on top. They are actually called Dhaka ko Topi meaning headgear. These ‘topis’ are made from cotton imported from Dhaka(Bangladesh). They are symbolic of the Nepalese culture and are also presented during Dashain and Tihar festivals. Nepal boasts of ‘Palpali Dhaka’ products like Shawls, handkerchiefs, ties and even table mats. A long time ago, Palpa was the only place to produce Dhaka clothes with shiny fabrics. However as time passed by, the other districts caught up too. Today they are sold widely throughout Nepal ranging from street-side stores to huge retailers.</p>

 <h2>Pashmina Products (The ‘Soft Gold’)</h2>     
   <p>The most sought after of all the handicrafts of Nepal, are Pashmina products that are also famous worldwide. The word Pashmina is taken from Persian language meaning “Made from wool”. Pashmina is a special type of Kashmiri (Locally pronounced as Cashmere) wool extracted and hand weaved resulting in a very fine texture. Pashmina products are famous both in Nepal as well as in Kashmir. Pashmina products are usually very high priced due to the rarity of Pashmina wool and the degree of expertise that goes into weaving it. Pashmina product ranges from scarves to sweaters and are sold widely in roadside stalls.</p>

  <h2>Felt Products</h2>     
   <p>Felt is said to be one of the oldest material for handicrafts of Nepal which find its use in a wide range of products starting from the automotive industry, art and design instruments as well as musical instruments.

    <h2>Handmade Paper Products</h2>     
   <p>Handmade paper was introduced in Nepal by the Tibetan travellers who migrated into this region. The traditional process of making one of the oldest handicrafts in Nepal is by recycling waste paper and is a cumbersome technique. It has a very unique texture which allows natural ink to stay for a long time hence making preservation of writings permissible. It is vastly used for gifting and using as a reliable product to write on. The handmade paper also finds its use in gift wrappings and calendars. Innumerable art shops in Nepal sell beautiful paper paintings, Lokta paper notebooks, paper sheets, lampshades as well as greetings cards made from handmade paper.</p>

   <h2>Jewellery</h2>     
   <p>Nepal is the ninth biggest silver jewellery producing country in Asia. The best selection of beads and jewellery can be found in the local markets of Kathmandu. Nepal holds a good name for selling items that are authentic and made in Nepal itself. The jewellery there are quite affordable and would not lead to a pocket crunch. The Nepalese artisans hold expertise in carving out unique designs and product development. Silver making is a traditional occurrence in Nepal and has been passed down generations. It is a highly labour intensive job and creating more opportunities in this sector would directly result in more jobs for them. Markets of Nepal also sell a variety of locally made or Indian jewellery. Yak bone jewellery, with its unique engravings and designs, is also a hit among tourists. </p>

   <h2>Wood Craft</h2>     
   <p>Situated in the foothills of the Himalayas, Nepal is lucky to have received the lush green forests and hardwood trees. Needless to mention, these trees are a source of valuable timber which is extensively used by the residents. Wooden craft has been a glory of Nepalese architecture from times immemorial. 

     The Kasthamandap at Basantapur, Kathmandu, built around 1596, is one of the many examples of the fascinating piece of artwork. Pottery markets in Bhaktapur boast of its wide range of wooden pottery and handicrafts of Nepal. Items include wooden decor items, wooden flute, wooden bracelets and a lot more.</p>

   <h2>Thangka</h2>     
   <p>Thangka painting is a Buddhist painting made on cotton and silk. When they are not used for display, they are rolled and kept on a textile backing which looks like Chinese scroll paintings, with a silk cover. They can last for a long time. But they are of delicate nature, that's why they are kept in dry places so that it doesn't get affected by moisture. The painting depicts a Buddhist deity or a scene. They serve as important teaching tools. Thangka painting are used for devotional and decorative purposes. There are workshops held by famous thangka painters who teach the visitors the importance and procedure that goes in the making of the painting.</p>

   <h2>Khukuri (The Gurkha knife)</h2>
