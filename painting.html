    <h1>Nepalese Painting</h1> 
    <hr>
    <p>Nepalese religious painting, whether for Hindu or Buddhist patrons, is conservative in technique, style, and iconography. However, over the course of centuries, subtle changes can be seen in composition, palette, style, and motifs. Artists from the primarily Buddhist community of Newars, one of Nepal’s many ethnic groups, made most of the paintings that illuminated manuscripts and book covers as well as devotional paintings on cloth (paubhas). Newari artists were renowned throughout Asia for the high quality of their workmanship. In certain periods, their style had tremendous influence on the art of Tibet and China. Both countries also used artists from Nepal to work on important commissions.</p>

  <h2> Chakrasamvara Mandala</h2>
   
   <p>This ritual diagram (mandala) is conceived as the cosmic palace of the wrathful Chakrasamvara and his consort, Vajravarahi, seen at center. These deities embody the esoteric knowledge of the Yoga Tantras. Six goddesses on stylized lotus petals surround the divine couple. Framing the mandala are the eight great burial grounds of India, each presided over by a deity beneath a tree. The cemeteries are appropriate places for meditation on Chakrasamvara and are emblematic of the various realms of existence. The lower register contains five forms of the goddess Tara, a tantric adept at left, and two donors at right. This mandala is one of the earliest surviving large-scale paintings known from Nepal. Stylistic features relate it to Nepalese manuscript covers and to eastern Indian palm-leaf manuscript illustrations of the twelfth century.</p>

 <h2>Pair of Manuscript Covers with Buddhist Deities</h2>     
   <p>This pair of wooden covers protected the palm-leaf folios of a Buddhist sacred text. One cover has the nine Buddhist goddesses, each holding a staff surmounted by the wish-fulfilling jewel (cintamani), while the other cover has the five transcendental Buddhas flanked by four bodhisattvas. Painted on the interior, the iconography offers a protective field to the holy text within, in this case likely the Perfection of Wisdom text, the Ashtasathasrika Prajnaparamita Sutra.</p>

    </div>
  <h2>Pair of Manuscript Covers with Buddhist Scenes</h2>     
   <p>Early Nepalese and Indian books derive their format from the long, narrow pieces of dried palm leaf that serve as their pages. The horizontal leaves were not bound together but, rather, kept in sequence by strings that passed through holes. These, in turn, were aligned with others inside wooden covers, which kept the pages flat and safe when the book was stored. The inside surfaces of these covers were often richly illuminated with groups of deities and, less frequently, scenes from the Buddha's life. Usually, little correspondence can be found between the subject of the paintings and the text recorded in the manuscripts.</p>

  <h2>Manuscript Cover with Vishnu Flanked by Lakshmi and Sarasvati</h2>     
     <p>This cover depicts a standing four-armed Vishnu mounted on Garuda, his half-man, half-bird vehicle. Vishnu is flanked on the right by his wife Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth and prosperity, and on the left by Sarasvati, the goddess of learning and wisdom, who sometimes appears as Vishnu's consort. Three of Vishnu's four hands hold his usual martial attributes, which he uses when he aids devotees in need: the discus, club, and conch shell (used to call troops). His fourth hand makes the gesture of teaching (dharmachakramudra). Lakshmi can be identified by the vase and lotus she holds. The four-armed Sarasvati can be identified by the rosary and book she holds in her upper hands and by the musical instrument she cradles in her lower hands. The deities' round faces and pronounced chins as well as the tone-on-tone scrolling vines between each deity are stylistically typically Nepalese.</p>

     </div>
    <h2>Mandala of Chandra, God of the Moon</h2>     
   <p>The center of this mandala depicts the moon god Chandra flanked by two female archers who shoot arrows of light to drive away the darkness. Chandra holds two lotuses and rides a chariot pulled by seven geese, an arrangement that parallels depictions of the sun god Surya, whose chariot is pulled by horses. Surrounding the central tableau are the nine planetary deities, which includes another depiction of Chandra. Across the top of the painting are the five directional buddhas (tathagatha) flanked by bodhisattvas at either end. The bottom register is divided into three panels that depict, from left to right, a ceremony, a group of musicians and dancers, and a group of patrons. Worship of the moon god Chandra was popular in Nepali Buddhism in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, although it appears to have declined thereafter.</p>
