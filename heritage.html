  <h2> The Pashupatinath Temple</h2>
  
   
   <p>Pashupatinath is one of the four most important religious sites in Asia for devotees of Shiva. It was built in the 5th century which was later renovated by Malla kings. The site itself is said to have existed from the beginning of the millennium when a Shiva lingam was discovered here. Pashupatinath is the largest temple complex in Nepal. It stretches on both sides of the Bagmati River which is considered holy by Hindus.  The main pagoda style temple has a gilded roof, four sides covered in silver, and exquisite wood carvings. Temples dedicated to several other Hindu and Buddhist deities surround the temple of Pashupatinath. Cremation of followers of Hindu religion take place on raised platforms along the river. The temple area includes Depatan, Jaya Bageshwori, Gaurighat (Holy Bath), Kutumbahal, Gaushala, Pingalasthan and Sleshmantak forest. There are around 492 temples, 15 Shivalayas (shrines of Lord Shiva) and 12 Jyotirlinga (phallic shrines) to explore.</p>

    </div>
 <h2>Swoyambhunath Temple</h2>     
   <p>This is believed to be 25 centuries old and stands as one of the world's oldest Buddhist Chaityas (Stupa). The great Stupa of Swayambhunath is the wonder that was Nepal, the glory that was Nepal. It is indeed listed a world Heritage site of Culture to prove that it serves as the nerve centre of faithful worship for all the devout Buddhists of the universe. Swayambhunath embraces the authentic philosophy of Bajrayan in Particular and honour Lord Adi Buddha. It is dedicated to self-originating flame god. 
     The Stupa, which forms the salient structure, is well composed of a solid hemisphere of terra-cotta bricks and soil supporting a cornice of copper and gilt. Painted in the four-sided base of the spare are the all-seeing eyes of Lord Buddha, keeping an eternal watch on the valley distinguishing between vice and virtue. It is some 2 miles west of Kathmandu City, proper across the holy Bishnumati River (Bagmati). </p>

  <h2>Patan Durbar Square</h2>     
   <p>Patan is 5 km away from the capital city, Kathmandu, and is reached by crossing the Bagmati River. Despite its proximity to Kathmandu, it still retains its old world charm and traditional professions such as woodcarving and especially metal crafts. As you walk through the city you still hear the tapping of tiny hammers as a craftsman works on a statuette or ornament. Patan is full of temples and monasteries which look similar in their pagoda style architecture and wood-carved windows. The district is known as Lalitpur which covers a vast area that includes the hills nearby.  </p>

    </div>
    <h2>Bhaktapur Durbar Square</h2>     
   <p>Among the three major cities of Kathmandu Valley, Bhaktapur retains some of its ancient way of life, reminding you of what the entire Kathmandu Valley must have looked like during the medieval period. The remarkable architecture, the exquisite woodcarvings and metal craft that can be seen around the city takes one back to the time of the Malla rulers who patronized art like no other dynasty. The pagoda style temples rise above the Bhaktapur skyline. The Pottery Square, the Palace (Durbar) Square which dates back to the 12th century, where devotees still celebrate their centuries old festivals and the temple squares that still remain vibrant, are Bhaktapur’s major attractions. But the city’s archaic look itself draws tourists besides the elaborate festivals that remain unchanged for centuries. The Durbar Square is one of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites of the valley.</p>

   </div>
    <h2>Lumbini</h2>     
   <p>The Lord Buddha was born in 623 BC in the sacred area of Lumbini located in the Terai plains of southern Nepal, testified by the inscription on the pillar erected by the Mauryan Emperor Asoka in 249 BC. Lumbini is one of the holiest places of one of the world's great religions, and its remains contain important evidence about the nature of Buddhist pilgrimage centres from as early as the 3rd century BC.
      The complex of structures within the archaeological conservation area includes the Shakya Tank; the remains within the Maya Devi Temple consisting of brick structures in a cross-wall system dating from the 3rd century BC to the present century and the sandstone Ashoka pillar with its Pali inscription in Brahmi script. Additionally there are the excavated remains of Buddhist viharas (monasteries) of the 3rd century BC to the 5th century AD and the remains of Buddhist stupas (memorial shrines) from the 3rd century BC to the 15th century AD.</p>

    <h2>Changunarayan Temple</h2>     
   <p>Changu Narayan is a two-story pagoda-style temple dedicated to Lord Vishnu and surrounded by ancient carvings and statues. Having survived destruction in 1702 and 2015, it is said to be the oldest Hindu temple still in use in the Kathmandu Valley today.
     The entire Kathmandu Valley is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site, encompassing seven groups of monuments and buildings. These include the Durbar Squares of Hanuman Dhoka (Kathmandu), Patan and Bhaktapur; the Buddhist stupas of Swayambhunath and Boudhanath; and the Hindu temples of Pashupati and Changu Narayan.
     Dating back to the fourth century, Changu Narayan is widely considered to be the oldest Hindu temple in Bhaktapur, and one of the oldest in Nepal. Built on top of a high hill about seven miles directly east of Kathmandu, the temple is dedicated to Vishnu, although shrines to Lord Shiva, Ashta Matrika, Chhinnamasta, Kileshwor, and Krishna are also found within the wider temple complex.

 </div>

    <h2>Boudhanath Stupa</h2>     
   <p>Boudhanath Stupa was probably built in the 14th century after the Mughal invasions; various interesting legends are told regarding the reasons for its construction. After the arrival of thousands of Tibetans following the 1959 Chinese invasion, the temple has become one of the most important centers of Tibetan Buddhism. Today it remains an important place of pilgrimage and meditation for Tibetan Buddhists and local Nepalis, as well as a popular tourist site.
    From above, Boudhanath Stupa looks like a giant mandala, or diagram of the Buddhist cosmos. And as in all Tibetan mandalas, four of the Dhyani Buddhas mark the cardinal points, with the fifth, Vairocana, enshrined in the center (in the white hemisphere of the stupa). The five Buddhas also personify the five elements (earth, water, fire, air and ether), which are represented in the stupa's architecture.

  <h2>Sagarmatha National Park</h2>     
   <p>Including the highest point on the Earth’s Surface, Mount Sagarmatha (Everest; 8,848 m) and an elevation range of 6,000 m Sagarmatha National Park (SNP) covers an area of 124,400 hectares in the Solu-Khumbu district of Nepal.

      Encompassing the infinitely majestic snow capped peaks of the Great Himalayan Range, the chain of mountains including the world’s highest Mt. Sagarmatha (Everest) and extensive Sherpa settlements that embody the openness of SNP to the rest of the world. The carefully preserved natural heritage and the dramatic beauty of the high, geologically young mountains and glaciers were recognized by UNESCO with the inscription of the park as a world heritage site in 1979. </p>
